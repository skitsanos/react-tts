The user interface includes text-to-speech synthesis, enabling users to convert text input into speech. It also features buttons for playing various audio fillers, demonstrating how to load and utilize these audio messages effectively. The `TalkButton` component is central to this functionality, managing the microphone input, starting and stopping recordings, and handling the data availability event to process and play the recorded audio.

```typescript
<TalkButton canRecord={true}
                        onDebugMessage={console.log}
                        onDataAvailable={async data =>
                        {
                            console.log(data);
                            await playAudio(data);
                        }}/>
```



### Where to Go Next

To further enhance this demo application, consider integrating OpenAI's Whisper for transcribing the captured audio. Whisper is a powerful tool for converting spoken language into text, which can then be processed by other AI models or used directly to generate responses. Integrating Whisper involves capturing the audio through the existing microphone setup, sending the audio data to Whisper for transcription, and then handling the transcribed text within the application.

Key steps for integrating Whisper:

1. **Capture Audio**: Use the existing microphone setup to capture the user's audio input.
2. **Send Audio to Whisper**: Implement a function to send the captured audio data to Whisper's API for transcription.
3. **Handle Transcribed Text**: Receive the transcribed text from Whisper and use it for further processing, such as sending it to OpenAI Assistant for generating responses.

By integrating Whisper, you can provide a more seamless and intuitive user experience, allowing users to interact with the application using natural language. This addition will enhance the assistant's capability to understand and respond to user queries effectively.
